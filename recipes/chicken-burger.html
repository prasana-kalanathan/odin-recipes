    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This burger delivers the bold flavors of Buffalo wings minus the mess and calories. Serve with additional hot sauce on the side.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the sour cream, blue cheese, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix the ground chicken, 1/4 cup hot sauce, celery salt, poultry seasoning, paprika, and cayenne pepper together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken burgers on the preheated grill 6 to 7 minutes until well marked. Spray the uncooked top of the burger with cooking spray, and flip the burgers over. Brush the cooked side with 1 tablespoon hot sauce, and continue cooking until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble the burgers, place a lettuce leaf on each roll bottom. Top with a burger patty, then spoon on 2 tablespoons of blue cheese sauce, and 2 tablespoons celery. Place the top of the roll on top to finish the sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
